## Project Overview and Concept
Drawing inspiration from the UX of apps like OfferUp and LetGo, 
Post-It aims to give the user a way to find and sell goods.


- The Post-It Project’s mission is to enable a hyper-local gift economy, 
in order to curb needless consumption, engender human connection, and promote sustainability.

- Our app contributes to this mission by making the experience of offering and accepting goods 
as safe and friction-free as possible.

## Minimum Viable Product:

 - User stories:
 
   Since this is essentially a two-sided marketplace, we have two User personas,
   Listers (the “sellers”) and Searchers (“buyers”). (An interesting wrinkle here is that 
   in some sense the Listers are themselves receiving a service—probing that may bear fruit.)

    As a Lister, In order to keep my life clutter-free as easily as possible, I want to snap a photo of 
    things I want to be rid of and have someone come pick it up to take it away.

    As a Lister, I want to provides my services to the community as a way to hone my skills, connect with 
    people as well as giving back to the community.

    As a Searcher, In order to fill a specific need, I want to easily see listings for free items and 
    details relevant to making a decision to invest the time into picking it up.
